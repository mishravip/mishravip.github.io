Due to the increasing capability of drones and requirements to monitor remote areas, drone surveillance is becoming popular.

In case of natural disaster, it can scan the wide affected-area quickly and make the search and rescue (SAR) faster to save more human lives. However, using autonomous drone for search and rescue is least explored and require attention of researchers to develop efficient algorithms in autonomous drone surveillance. Proposed model achieves 0.98mAP when applied on proposed dataset which is a significant contribution. In addition, proposed model achieve 7% higher mAP value when applied to standard Okutama dataset in comparison with the state-of-the-art detection models in literature.
